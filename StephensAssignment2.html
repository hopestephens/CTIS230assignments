    <h2>Space Exploration and the United States</h2>
    <p><a href="StephensAssignment3-1.html">Spanish</a></p>
  	<p><a href="StephensAssignment3.html">Resume</a></p>
  	<p>Every year, millions of dollars taken from taxpayers are used to fund America’s space exploration programs (Roberts). Space exploration is highly controversial in the US because it requires a huge amount of money and doesn’t seem to be vital for anything, unlike healthcare or education. The idea of discovering foreign objects in space is spectacular, of course, but why spend six percent of the federal income building machines when the money could be used to cure common and fatal diseases, pay off the national debt, or improve our country’s education and social services (Chamberlain). The importance of space exploration is more complex than what meets the eye. While other programs in the country are also crucial, space exploration makes us subconsciously more aware of the future, present, and past; it unifies us as a species; and it allows us to fulfill our moral obligations as humans. America’s space exploration programs should continue to receive federal funding.</p>
  	<p>To ensure long-term survival, people should always be looking ahead into the future. Scientists have predicted the future of the Earth based on the current rates of pollution, deforestation, and other major types of resource depletion, and there isn’t a positive outlook. People first realized that we are destroying the Earth hundreds of years ago, so why haven’t we fixed the issue yet? The amount of damage we have already done is extensive, and it may take a while to replenish all natural resources, but there has been progress since the first discovery of this global problem. The amount of people who are aware of global warming and resource depletion has increased dramatically over the past few years. Very gradually, the rate at which the Earth is deteriorating is decreasing, because more sustainable ways of life have been developed. The reason why people are taking this topic much more seriously is that because of space exploration, there are images of how the Earth has been affected by humans (Collins). In pictures, Earth looks like a tiny oasis of life struggling to survive against the black vacuum of space, making our planet seem fragile yet necessary for our survival. This is enough motivation for people to support conservation efforts. These documents allow everyone to get a visual idea of what is happening, and they forced people who were skeptical to believe that our situation is real. Kennedy was the first president to fund a space exploration program. He was also an environmentalist. Compared to presidents before him, he was much more serious about preserving the Earth, and he even influenced American citizens to share these ideas. If going just beyond the Earth’s horizon can give us information about the world’s future, who knows what scientists will discover if people can go even further than that? To fix the state of our planet, the majority of people worldwide must be involved. They will be much more likely to be worried if they can have a visual depiction of what is going on. In a way, space exploration can help ensure the long-term survival of humans.</p>
  	<p>By exploring what surrounds planet Earth, researchers have come up with ideas about the position of Earth relative to everything else in the solar system. So far, there has not been any discovered signs of life within hundreds of thousands of astronomical units away from Earth, and this planet seems to be the only one that can be inhabited by humans. These statements cause us to believe that humans must support each other and try to survive together, because this planet and population are the only known resources we have. Right now, the human race is far from unified, due to divisions over nationality, socioeconomic status, and more. More space exploration can help bridge this gap. Once everyone will work together, one can only imagine the things that will become possible. Michael Collins, a former astronaut, once wrote, “when viewing the earth from space, there are no borders, just Earth, full of people who have created borders”. Countries like Russia, China, and India have expressed interest in going to space, and this unified goal has the power to encourage different countries to become one in order to “benefit the entire globe.” Perhaps taking a 100,000 mile step away from society will fundamentally change the way we view the world around us, and ourselves.</p>
  <p>The endeavor of space exploration faces many counter- arguments, one such being that scientists have no way of knowing what is in space without venturing to other planets, posing threats to the human population. Richard Greenberg, an American scientist, claims that extraterrestrial life could be different than any life found on earth, and could lead to possible contamination if not dealt with in a safe and procedural manner. However, although unknown life forms such as microbes and “aliens” have the chance of being malevolent to mankind, there is untapped potential to find answers to sciences greatest questions. Greenberg makes mention of microbes and how their unknown traits could cause unknown illnesses, but it is equally possible that new life could hold the cures for some of our deadliest diseases. Why deny a possible cure? This “hypothetically other-world microbe” is just that, hypothetical. It's a risk that astronauts have to take, when out in space lies the hypothetical fountain of life (Greenberg).</p>
  	<p>Space is the final frontier. It is the obligation of mankind to venture forth and explore it- if not us, then who? The lack of enthusiasm for space exploration is rooted in the fear of the unknown. For centuries it has been this way, and for centuries the human nature to seek knowledge has overcome that fear. When the first humans migrated from Africa to other areas of the world, they were driven by their innate curiosity and thirst for adventure. We have roamed the world around us horizontally, and now the only way to go is up. It is no use to hold back funding for space exploration when exploration is inevitable.</p>
